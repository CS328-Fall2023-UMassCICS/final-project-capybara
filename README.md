# Arduino Step Tracker, Final Project CS328

# Problem Statement
- Although we have learned to do step detection with pre-recorded data and potentially using phone data, we decided to do a little challange. 
- We wanted to see if it's possiable to do real-time data processing on a small arduino microcontroller to make a step tracker.

# Potential application of the project
- There may not be a lot of practical application of this project because there are way better step detection algorithms out there, including phones. 
- This project was done as a learning experience and for fun, and it's also always cool to make hardware stuff. 
# Technical knowledge
- 
# Code implementation
- 

# Result
- We are able to implement a variation of the z-score smoothing algrithm to combile data smoothing and peak detection, filtering is harder to implement
- The device is functional and counting steps. 
  
# Learning outcome
- 

# Future improvements
 - Dynamically adjust z-score threashold for variation in steps. 
 - Improve the smoothing and filtering algorithm to better process accelerometer data.
